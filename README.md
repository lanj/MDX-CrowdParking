# MDX CROWDSOURCE PARKING APP

Parking Locator Mobile App

This is a project to develop a mobile application to aid users in their search for parking spaces through the use of web technology, API's and crowdsourcing techniques. 

The aim is to give the user access to parking information by gathering crowd sourced data which can provide more time-sensitive, accurate information on both location and availability of parking resources. Coupled together other authoritative source of information (Mash-up, see reference 3), it hopes to provide users with usability and functionality that can make searching for parking spaces more practicable and user friendly while in traffic or in a hurry.

The project uses available / open-source web solutions, and functionality of smart-phone / tablet.
