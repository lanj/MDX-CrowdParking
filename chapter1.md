# Introduction



This project investigates the feasibility of crowd-sourcing for providing parking solutions.

The project aims are the following:

* To give the user access to parking information through crowd sourced data.
* Develop web application as platform to provide information .
* Use open-source technology and Mash-up technology to make it available to users.
* Evaluation of the project by comparing the project with similar technology on market.


The project uses available / open-source web solutions, and functionality of smart-phone / tablet.  



## About mobile crowd-sourcing
Crowdsourcing is application of collective intelligence from a heterogeneous group of people voluntarily partaking in a task of mutual benefit. With mobile-crowdsourcing, geo-location data can be gathered either from a userâ€™s mobile phone location or alternatively self-reporting otherwise known as check-in data.  Check-in data is generated by the participant voluntarily recording their location on their mobile device (see Wang M et al, 2012).

**Argument for crowdsourcing **


---



The argument for the use of Mobile crowd-sourcing has been its successful application by other companies such as Google-map for gathering data on congestion. Its main advantage is access to time-sensitive data in finding the closest available parking location within the users immediate area.

**Argument against crowdsourcing**


---

Success of crowdsourcing is dependent on the confidence of the data and system, the uptake or participation of users and validity of the data processed.

A major issue would be ability of users to update data available, failure of participants to do this can create data gaps due to none use.

Another issue is confidence and validity of data , crowdsource data can suffer loss of data integrity from data pollution, which in term  can affect both confidence and validity. 

Using previous research carried out by [ParkJam](http://parking.kmi.open.ac.uk/)  (Kopeck, Jacek & Domingue, John, 2012), the project intends to address issues such as incentives for takeup of users, addressing possible weakness of geo-data type as spatial and data bias when related to parking in particular facilities.

**Take up**
Crowd-source motivation to participate can either be  intrinsic or extrinsic. While it is hoped that the rewards gained from using the device will be a sufficient motivator, the project has also adapted Gamification as additional incentive.

## Constraints 

Evaluation and testing was focused within small area to manage risks  small number of participants.

The technology and platform used creates constraints on development and performance.  






## Implementation and evaluation
To ensure widest participation of users the project used mobile cross platform for deployment.

The project used web-browser and hybrid mobile development as the platform. 

Employing web-browser will ensure broaden participation of users with different mobile devices. 

The project reuses web 2.0 technology, Google map for displaying geo-location data which is needed to identify places of interest (POI) for end users. 

The project employed staged releases for development of the project to ensure reuse of components and a working product at each milestone.  




## Resources

The project makes use of the following resources for implementation of the application. For more information please refer to the links 

**GOOGLE MAPS API**: Google provides Application program interface (API) to allow access to google's web services. The project makes use of the googlemap api for access to geo-location services.  Google maps API is implemented using HTML5 and JavaScript language. For more information click the following link about [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/).

**GEOJSON** : Technology used for encoding geographic features as well as their non-spatial attributes. Geojson is derived from JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). The Project uses Geojson for setting coordinates and parking information for each parking feature. Click on link to know more about [GEOJSON](http://geojson.org/).

**JQUERY**: JavaScript Library used for scripting stylesheets used in html pages. Click on link to know more about [JQUERY](http://jquery.com/).

**JQuery mobile**: JavaScript Library based on JQuery but developed for use on mobile platforms.Click on link to know more about  [JQUERY MOBILE](https://jquerymobile.com/).

**Html5** provides tags "W3C GEOLOCATION" for Geolocation which can be used on web pages and web-application. Click on link to find out more about [HTML5 ](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/.
