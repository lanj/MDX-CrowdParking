# Introduction



This project investigates the feasibility of crowd-sourcing for providing parking solutions.

The project aims are the following:

* To give the user access to parking information through crowd sourced data.
* Develop web application as platform to provide information .
* Use open-source technology and Mash-up technology to make it available to users.
* Evaluation of the project by comparing the project with similar technology on market.


The project uses available / open-source web solutions, and functionality of smart-phone / tablet.  



## About Crowdsourcing






## Implementation and evaluation
To ensure widest participation of users the project used mobile cross platform for deployment.

The project used web-browser and hybrid mobile development as the platform. 

Employing web-browser will ensure broaden participation of users with different mobile devices. 

The project reuses web 2.0 technology, Google map for displaying geo-location data which is needed to identify places of interest (POI) for end users. 

The project employed staged releases for development of the project to ensure reuse of components and a working product at each milestone.  It will use native hybrid to ensure access to native features for location services.  And will mitigate risk by focusing on developing small pilot prototype which will provide information about parking in a small area and will involve using small number of participants.
